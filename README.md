# DSA-Leetcode

A collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) solutions from LeetCode problems, implemented in Java.

## About This Project

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. The solutions are organized in text files for easy reference and sharing. Each solution includes:
- Problem number and title
- Direct link to the LeetCode problem
- Java implementation with comments

## Repository Structure

- **Details.txt** - List of problems covered with their LeetCode links
- **Dpp1.txt** - Java solutions for multiple LeetCode problems
- **Dpp2.txt** - Placeholder for additional solutions

## Problems Covered

### Array Problems
1. **Two Sum** - [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
2. **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock** - [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/)
3. **Find the Duplicate Number** - [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/description/)
4. **Product of Array Except Self** - [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/description/)
5. **Maximum Subarray** - [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/description/)
6. **Maximum Product Subarray** - [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/description/)

### Linked List Problems
7. **Add Two Numbers** - [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)

### String Problems
8. **Roman to Integer** - [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/description/)

## How to Use

1. Browse through the text files to find solutions to specific problems
2. Each solution includes the problem link, so you can reference the original problem on LeetCode
3. Solutions are written in Java and include explanatory comments

## Solutions Format

Each solution follows this format:
```java
// [Problem Number]. [Problem Title]
// [LeetCode URL]

class Solution {
    // Implementation with comments
}
```

## Contributing

This is a personal practice repository where I upload solutions that I've solved on LeetCode. Feel free to use these solutions as reference for your own learning.

## Notes

- All solutions are tested and accepted on LeetCode
- Solutions may not always be the most optimal, but they demonstrate working approaches
- Comments are included to explain the logic and approach
